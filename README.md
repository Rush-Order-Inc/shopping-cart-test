## Shopping cart app

Our company needs a shopping cart app. We've assigned the ticket to someone who's new to React.
He's quite proud of his work, but it's buggy and unoptimized.

You'll help us give him a code review.
Please improve his code.

Project requirements:
- client fetches from API to get list of products once on initial load
- user can add items to cart
- cart items are saved to local storage
- user can change quantities (in intervals of minus 1, plus 1, and plus 2)
- user can view total cost dynamically

Stretch goal:
- shopping cart quantity should be saved and pulled from local storage
